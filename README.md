## Compatibility and Requirements

- **Platform Compatibility**: Two binary files are provided with this release:
    - `imgcat_intelx86` is built for Macs using Intel architecture.
    - `imgcat_m1` is built for Macs with M1 architecture.
  Please download the binary corresponding to your machine's architecture.

- **Terminal Compatibility**: This tool is optimized for use in iTerm2 with the `imgcat` feature. For the best experience, please use iTerm2 as your terminal. Make sure that both the executable file and the `imgcat.sh` script are located in the same directory.

## Using imgdogcat in VSCode Terminal

To properly use imgdogcat in the Visual Studio Code terminal and display images directly, you must enable the option to support images within VSCode settings. Follow these steps to enable image support:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Preferences > Settings` on Mac).
3. In the search bar at the top, type `Terminal > Integrated: Enable Images`.
4. Find the setting labeled **Enable Images** under the section **Terminal > Integrated**.
5. Check the box next to **Enable Images** to allow images to be displayed in the terminal.
6. Restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.

- Once you've enabled this option, you should be able to use imgdogcat in your VSCode terminal and see images directly in the output.
- But gif images are not supported in the VSCode terminal. ðŸ¥²


## Installation

1. Download the appropriate binary for your architecture.
2. Ensure you have the `imgcat.sh` script in the same directory as the downloaded binary.
3. Change the permissions to allow execution of the binary:

    ```bash
    chmod +x imgdogcat_m1 imgdogcat_intelx86 imgcat.sh
    ```

## Usage

Execute the binary with your choice of option:

```bash
./imgdogcat --cat   # Displays a random cat image
./imgdogcat --dog   # Displays a random dog image
./imgdogcat --gif  # Displays a random gif image
./imgdogcat --search # Displays a random gif image within searched category
./imgdogcat --api <your_api_key> --gif # Displays a random gif image with your own api key
./imgdogcat         # Randomly displays a cat or dog image
```
